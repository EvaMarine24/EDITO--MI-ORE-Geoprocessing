    "## Summary\n",
    "This script takes shapefiles for geoprocessing to identify the most suitable ORE development locations. This is done by taking a baseline shapefile, such as bathymetry, and clipping out constraints that will result in a \"Suitability Area\" shapefile that can be mapped in a viewer, such as Terria. Any shapefile that requires a buffer, can be processed using our \"Shapefile Buffer\" script.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use the Irish data and clip bathymetry by the following constraints, according to our National Marine Planning policy:\n",
    "- Depth (>150m for floating and 80m for offshore)\n",
    "- Ferry Routes (with 5km buffer)\n",
    "- Shipwrecks (with 500m buffer)\n",
    "- Special Areas of Conservation\n",
    "- Special Protected Areas\n",
    "- Defence Restriction Zones\n",
    "\n",
    "The shapefiles  you are using are imported from S3 storage and output to S3 for inclusion in your web viewer. If you are pulling spatial data from a public Feature server, we recommend using our \"Feature to Shapefile\" notebook in this folder to query and download your feature service layer as a shapefile to S3 storage. You can also pull from an Image server and convert image to raster for analysis and save as a shapefile as we have done with our bathymetry layer in \"Image to Shapefile\"."

If pulling from an Image server, you can see \"Image to Shapefile\" where we have performed clipping on our initial bathymetry layer.
